# How to Use

## Command Line Options / Command Line Arguments

This script/program supports several argument parameters that can be used. Here's an explanation of the arguments:

`--data` / `-D` can be used when you have a different file name for storing account data. By default, the file name used by this script/program to store account data is `data.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `query.txt` as the file that stores account data, just run `bot.py` by adding the `--data` / `-D` argument. Example: `python bot.py --data query.txt`

`--proxy` / `-P` can be used when you have a different file name for storing the proxy list. The file name used by this script/program to store the proxy list is `proxies.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `prox.txt` as the file that stores the proxy list, you just need to add the `--proxy` / `-P` argument parameter to use your proxy file. Example: `python bot.py --proxy prox.txt`

`--worker` / `-W` this argument is used to customize the number of threads/workers used when this bot script runs. By default, this script/software uses (total CPU cores / 2) workers. For example, if your CPU has 6 cores, the number of workers used is 3. You can customize the number of workers using this argument. For example, if you want to set the number of workers to 100, run `bot.py` with this argument: `python bot.py --worker 100`. And if you don't like using workers/threads/multiprocessing, you can customize the worker to 1, example: `python bot.py --worker 1`.

`--action` / `-A` this argument is used to directly enter the desired menu. For example, if this bot script has 5 menus and you don't want to input manually, you can use this argument to directly enter the desired menu. Example: `python bot.py --action 5` means you will directly enter menu number 5. This argument is useful if you use docker/pm2 to run the bot script in the background process.

## About Proxies

Register on the following website to get free proxies: [Here](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=dwj0m9cdi4mp)

Website with the cheapest proxy price $1/GB [Here](https://dataimpulse.com/?aff=48082)

You can add the proxy list in the `proxies.txt` file and the proxy format is as follows:

If there is authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://user:password@hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://admin:admin@69.69.69.69:6969
```

If there is no authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://69.69.69.69:6969
```

Please pay close attention to whether the proxy you are using requires authentication or not, as many people DM me asking how to use proxies.

# JavaScript Code to Get Data in Telegram Desktop Application

Here are some JavaScript codes you can try to get data through the Telegram desktop application.

After you execute the code, try pasting it. If it doesn't appear, try another JavaScript code.
